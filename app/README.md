## üõµ ‚óç Demo: https://create-dapp-solana-nextjs.vercel.app/

This project includes:

- Next.JS
- TypeScript
- [@solana/wallet-adapter](https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter) and [@solana/web3.js](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js) for interactions with wallets & blockchain.
- Tailwind CSS (with [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/))

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn
yarn run dev
```

// TODO
If you deploy new Candy Machine you can update UI config here: `./src/config/candy-machine.config.js`.

## Style

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) or [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) are selected tools for rapid style development.

You can quickly change theme changing `daisy.themes` within `./tailwind.config.js`.
More info here: https://daisyui.com/docs/default-themes

This app encourage you to use CSS Modules over other style technics (like SASS/LESS, Styled Components, usual CSS).
It have modular nature and supports modern CSS. [Read more on Next.JS site](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support).
Anyway, if you want to connect LESS there is example code in `./next.config.js`

## Deploy on Vercel

Before push run localy `npm run build` to make sure app can be build succesffully on vercel .

Vercel will automatically create environment and deployment for you if you have vercel account connected to your GitHub account. Go to the vercel.com to connect it.
Then any push to `main` branch will automatically rebuild and redploy app.

### Possible Issues 

- You might [need to overwrite default output derictory](https://github.com/thuglabs/create-dapp-solana-nextjs/issues/23) for vercel settings if you see [`Routes Manifest Could Not Be Found
`](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/blob/main/errors/now-next-routes-manifest.md) error.
